# Phase Execution Prompt — action_relay

Implement only the requested phase.

Phase 1 focus:
- Make it trivially easy to submit a valid intent packet to intent_normaliser.
- Ensure examples conform to contracts.
- Keep tests docker-runnable: `docker compose run --rm test smoke`.

Update `docs/current_state.md` for behavioural changes.
